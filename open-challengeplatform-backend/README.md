In Postman is a Request called: `users - me` which has 3 different kvkmasterid headers. Each of these headers creates a different user
So head over to: 
[http://localhost:1337/admin/plugins/content-manager/plugins::users-permissions.user](http://localhost:1337/admin/plugins/content-manager/plugins::users-permissions.user)

Edit these users by adding a role to them.

Now you can create new resources (challenges, comments, etc.)
